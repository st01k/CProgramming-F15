\/\The Conscience of a Hacker/\/
+++The Mentor+++

January 8, 1986

This is our world now, the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without
paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering
gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore, and you call us
criminals.  We seek after knowledge, and you call us criminals.  We
exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias,
and you call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you
murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own
good, yet we're the criminals.  Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that
of curiosity.  My crime is that of judging people by what they say and
think, not what they look like.  My crime is that of outsmarting you,
something that you will never forgive me for.  I am a hacker, and this
is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us
all.  After all, we're all alike.
